                    Hackerspaces are about community, and we'd like to invite you to come visit ours - free
                    of charge! There are no restrictions, no fee, and no "right" kind of person. If you're
                    interested we'd love to show you what we've built, what we're creating, and hear about
                    what <em>you</em> want to make.<br><br>
                    We generally open from about 5pm onwards, and will have dinner at around 7pm. Sometimes
                    members will have a BBQ onsite for dinner, where anyone can join; make sure to bring
                    some change!<br><br>
                    You don't need to be a member to attend this, feel free to come along and socialise,
                    meet people, and talk about some awesome ideas!<br>

                    A hackerspace is a place where people with similar interests in technology, science,
                    art, culture, and craftsmanship meet. Activities are not in the slightest restricted
                    to only computer science, but also emerge from electronics, contemporary art, photography,
                    and any and all other pursuits worth sharing. The hackerspace offers a turnkey
                    infrastructure to its members where innovative projects that would not come to life
                    in a garage, find nourishment and support.<br><br>
                    This event is for:<br>
                    High school students, Graduate students, Post Graduate students, Employed adults,
                    Unemployed adults.<br><br>
                    Main Themes:<br>
